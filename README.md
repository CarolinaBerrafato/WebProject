# \<Web Project/\>
### This is my first project using HTML/CSS

#### I made it for Introduction to Computing, a 1st semester subject in Computer Science at UFPE!

If you want to check the results, this website is hosted in CIn's domain. Here's the [link](https://www.cin.ufpe.br/~mcsb3/View.html).

The project requirements were to make a website about yourself, so, since I love Harry Potter, I decided to follow the theme of my Harry Potter House (Ravenclaw). I had so much fun working on it!
